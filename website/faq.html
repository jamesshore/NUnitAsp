<h1 align="center">NUnitAsp Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>This document contains answers to questions that really are frequently asked about NUnitAsp.  It's not the best place to start for general information about NUnitAsp.  For an overview, see the <a href="quickstart.html">NUnitAsp QuickStart Guide</a>.  For a detailed tutorial, see the <a href="tutorial/index.html">NUnitAsp Tutorial</a>.  NUnitAsp is available for download at the <a href="http://nunitasp.sourceforge.net">NUnitAsp web site</a>.</p>

<p>At this time, there aren't many frequently asked questions, so this is a short document.</p>

<p><b>Q: When will NUnitAsp support NUnit 2.x?</b></p>

<p>A: NUnit 2.x support is a priority for us, and we'll start porting NUnitAsp to NUnit 2.0 as soon as it's released.  We won't port NUnitAsp to beta or release candidate versions of NUnit 2.0.  Porting looks like it's fairly painless, so we expect to have support ready soon after NUnit 2.0 is released.  Once we've migrated to NUnit 2.0, we'll stop supporting NUnit 1.x.</p>

<p><b>Q: When will NUnitAsp stop requiring XHTML?</b></p>

<p>A: That's our most important new feature, and is scheduled for version 1.3.  We don't have a specific release date.</p>
