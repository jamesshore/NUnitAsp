NUnitAsp

Changes in this version:
* Documentation.  Lots of it.
* Added support for pop-up windows in AnchorTester (thanks to Jacob Lawlor)
* 404 errors no longer occur when retrieving links to document fragments (http://foo.com/index.html#name).  The fragment link is ignored and the main page is retrieved.
* Fixed attribute parsing so it ignores case.
