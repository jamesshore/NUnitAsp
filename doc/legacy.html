            <h1>New Training Course:<br /><small>Test-Driven Development of Legacy ASP.NET<br />September 13-15, 2005</small></h1>

            <p>We are very proud to announce our first public training course, "Test-Driven Development of Legacy ASP.NET."  Co-developed by <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com">James Shore</a>, the primary developer of NUnitAsp, and <a href="http://www.netobjectives.com">Net Objectives</a>, creator of advanced developer training courses, this course is an authoritative look at an important issue.</p>

            <p>This three-day course will be held September 13-15.  For this initial course only, we are offering a special rate of $900 per person, approximately 25% off our normal price of $1195.  The course will be taught by James Shore himself and Rob Myers of Net Objectives.</p>

            <p>To register, email James Shore at jshore@jamesshore.com or call 503-267-5490.  Be prepared to provide your name, company name, and payables contact.  If registering for more than one person, please have their names and email addresses on hand.</p>

            <p>This course is also available as a private on-site course.  To arrange for this course to be delivered at your company, please contact James Shore as above.</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>

            <p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a powerful tool for combining software design, testing, and coding to increase reliability and productivity.  The ease of creating ASP and ASP.NET applications has led to "legacy" applications that don't have any tests, making changes risky.  Savvy developers have been looking for ways to apply TDD to existing code so they can make changes quickly and safely.</p>

            <p>NUnitAsp is the preeminent tool for TDD with ASP.NET.  Until now, it wasn't suitable for use with legacy ASP or ASP.NET applications.  With many legacy ASP applications in production and more legacy ASP.NET applications on the horizon, we've teamed up with James Shore, the primary developer of NUnitAsp, to add legacy support to NUnitAsp and co-develop and deliver this unique course.</p>

            <h2>What You Will Learn</h2>

            <p><i>Day 1: TDD with NUnitAsp</i></p>

            <p>What defines legacy code?  How can we maintain it?  Learn the answers to these questions, then take a deep breath as we immerse you in learning and experimenting with TDD using NUnitAsp.</p>

            <p><i>Day 2: Making Legacy Code Testable</i></p>

            <p>What's going on in legacy code that makes it so difficult?  Learn the ins and outs of NUnitAsp and build test-beds to isolate pages and user controls from the dependencies of login and navigation.</p>

            <p><i>Day 3: Dealing with Untestables</i></p>

            <p>What is "untestable"?  What can be done with tough external dependencies?  Learn how to use mock objects to isolate ASP.NET code-behind from the rest of your application.</p>

            <h2>Lab</h2>

            <p>All three days mix lecture, demonstrations, activities, and hands-on lab assignments.  Students are required to provide their own computer (see "Prerequisites").</p>

            <h2>Who This Course Is For</h2>

            <p>Software developers (engineers, programmers, whatever you wish to call yourselves) working with ASP or ASP.NET projects.  Managers and QA folks are always quite welcome, too, but must meet the prerequisites.</p>

            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>A strong grasp of one of the .NET languages, such as C#.NET or VisualBasic.NET.  Please note that samples, exercises, and demos are all done using C#.</li>
              <li>An understanding of basic web-application architecture.</li>
              <li>Some experience with ASP or ASP.NET web-application frameworks (or an innate ability to experiment and explore with a reckless fearlessness).</li>
              <li>A laptop or desktop computer with Visual Studio .NET and Internet Information Server (IIS) installed.</li>
              <li>Ample sleep, or the caffeinated beverage of your choice.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Course Length</h2>

            <p>3 days.</p>

            <h2>Instructors:</h2>

            <p><b>James Shore</b> created today's modern NUnitAsp while leading a team in the beta days of ASP.NET.  Unwilling to develop without the safety net of test-driven development, he took over an open-source application and updated it to support TDD of ASP.NET code-behind.  Since releasing NUnitAsp on SourceForge in 2002, he's seen it grow into an application that's downloaded thousands of times every month.</p>

            <p>James is a leader in the agile software development community.  In addition to producing NUnitAsp, he's the project maintainer for Fit, Ward Cunningham's tool for agile requirements testing and collaboration.  He's an assistant chair for the Agile 2005 software conference and he's authored numerous articles about agile software development.  James has been coaching teams in agile development since 1999.  He specializes in providing agile development consulting to the Pacific Northwest.  Find his articles and blog on his website, <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com">http://www.jamesshore.com</a>.</p>

            <p><b>Rob Myers</b> has nearly twenty years of professional experience in software development, including projects for industry leaders in medical, aerospace, and financial services.   In the late 90's, Rob became an Extreme Programming coach and traveled throughout the country assisting teams as they adopted agile practices and object-oriented design techniques.  Rob brings to the classroom his passion for value-oriented software development, team development, and sane work environments.</p>
