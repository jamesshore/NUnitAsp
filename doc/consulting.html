						<h1>Training and Consulting</h1>

						<p>We provide a range of on-site training and consulting services for organizations that need a additional help with NUnitAsp.  To book one of these sessions, contact <a href="mailto:jlittle@wgz.com">Jim Little</a>.  Unless otherwise noted, all of these sessions are offered at your site.  Because Jim's time is limited, we recommend reserving sessions as early as possible.

						<h2>Brown-Bag Lunches</h2>
						<p>We provide <b>free</b> one-hour introductions to NUnitAsp and test-driven development.  These sessions make a great brown-bag lunch for your development team, even if you're not planning on using NUnitAsp right away.  This service is available in the Portland, Oregon area.  Be sure to reserve your session well in advance.</p>

						<h2>Multi-Day Training Sessions</h2>
						<p>We provide training sessions for teams that are new to NUnitAsp.  Depending on the skill level of your team, we offer sessions ranging from one day to five days.  Our sessions teach a lot more than just NUnitAsp: we emphasize object-oriented software design, test-driven development, and refactoring as well.  If your team is new to ASP.NET, we can teach both NUnitAsp and ASP.NET as a single course.</p>

						<h2>Weekly Consulting</h2>
						<p>For teams that are already using NUnitAsp or that are on a tight schedule, we provide a weekly consulting option.  Our consultant will work with your team to refine their tests and solve knotty testing problems.  As with our training, your team will gain a lot more than just testing knowledge: our consultant will share insights on process, architecture, and design.  If you're on a tight schedule, this is a particularly cost-effective option.  Our consultant will work with your team on your current project, minimizing the impact on your schedule.</p>

						<h2>Coaching and Technical Leadership</h2>
						<p>If you're interested in immersing your team in agile software development, we provide full-lifecycle coaching and technical leadership options.  Our consultant can work with your technical lead to move your team to test-driven development and agile software development.  Or, if you don't have a qualified technical lead, we can fill that role directly.</p>

						<h2>Custom "Tester" Development</h2>
						<p>One of ASP.NET's strengths is the ability to create and sell custom controls.  If you've created a custom control, a corresponding "Tester" object will make it easier for your customers to test pages that use your control.  If your team doesn't have the time or expertise to create the tester themselves, we can create it for you.  This service can be provided at your site or at ours.</p>

						<h2>About Our Consultant</h2>

						<p>Our services are provided by Jim Little, the project coordinator for NUnitAsp.  Jim is an experienced consultant who has been coaching teams in test-driven development and agile methods since 1999.  He has been the driving force behind NUnitAsp for most of its life.  If your organization needs additional help with NUnitAsp, Jim is the most experienced source you can find.</p>
