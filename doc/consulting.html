            <h1>Coaching</h1>

            <p>Jim Shore, the project coordinator for NUnitAsp, is a professional agile development coach and consultant.  Jim is an expert in the area of agile development who has been helping companies achieve their goals with agile methods since 1999.  He provides a range of coaching services.  If you think Jim can help your company, call him at 503-267-5490.</p>

            <h2>Free Seminars</h2>
            <p>Jim provides free one-hour introductions to NUnitAsp and test-driven development.  These sessions make a great brown-bag lunch for your development team, even if you're not planning on using NUnitAsp right away.  This service is available in the Portland, Oregon area.  Be sure to reserve your session well in advance.</p>

            <h2>Introductory Coaching</h2>
            <p>Introductory coaching introduces test-driven development with NUnit and NUnitAsp to your team.  Jim works hands-on with your team, demonstrating how NUnit and NUnitAsp fit in with their current work.  If your team is new to C# and ASP.NET, we can include mentoring in these subjects as well.</p>

            <h2>Fencepost Coaching</h2>
            <p>"Fencepost coaching" occurs periodically over a period of months.  It's a good way to gradually introduce new skills to your team.  During each session, we review your team's progress, double-check our strategic direction, work hands-on with your team on a specific skill, and give a few concrete areas to improve by the next session.</p>

            <h2>Intensive Coaching</h2>
            <p>Titanium I.T. offers intensive coaching in increasing software development profitability.  This service extends beyond NUnitAsp: our coach works hands-on with your developers, management, and executives, providing expert guidance on all stages of a pilot project.  We pass on our knowledge to your leaders so that, when our engagement is complete, you will be prepared to roll out improvements across your organization.  This is an in-depth, hands-on service.</p>


            <br />
            <br />
            <h1>Custom Development</h1>

            <h2>Custom Tester Development</h2>
            <p>One of ASP.NET's strengths is the ability to create and sell custom controls.  If you've created a custom control, a corresponding NUnitAsp "Tester" object will make it easier for your customers to test pages that use your control.  If your team doesn't have the time or expertise to create the tester themselves, we can create it for you.  This service is provided at our site.</p>

            <h2>Funded NUnitAsp Development</h2>
            <p>If there's a feature or tester that you'd like us to include in NUnitAsp, and you don't feel like <a href="contribute.html">contributing</a> the code yourself, we can implement it for you.  Any feature implemented in this manner will be incorporated into the open-source release of NUnitAsp and included in our existing NUnitAsp maintenance efforts.  This service is provided at our site.</p>
