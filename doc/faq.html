						<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

						<p>The NUnitAsp team sees frequently asked questions as indicators of problems with NUnitAsp and its documentation.  We strive to eliminate FAQs, either by improving the documentation or (preferably) improving NUnitAsp itself.  As a result, there's not much in the way of FAQs.</p>

						<p>This also isn't the best place to start for general information about NUnitAsp.  For an overview, see the <a href="quickstart.html">NUnitAsp QuickStart Guide</a>.  For a detailed tutorial, see the <a href="tutorial/index.html">NUnitAsp Tutorial</a>.  For installation issues, see the <a href="installation.html">Installation Guide</a>.  NUnitAsp is available for download at the <a href="http://nunitasp.sourceforge.net">NUnitAsp web site</a>.</p>


						<h2>Q: When will NUnitAsp stop requiring XHTML?</h2>

						<p>A: XHTML is still required, and may always be, but with NUnitAsp v1.3 we now automatically compensate for common XHTML problems.  We no longer require a specific DOCTYPE tag or closed tags.  Visual Studio .NET HTML will work without modification.


						<h2>Q: When I try to compile NUnitAsp, I get a &quot;cryptographic failure&quot; error.  What's wrong?</h2>

						<p>A: The NUnitAsp DLL is <em>strong-named,</em> which means it must be signed by a cryptographic key.  If you try to compile without a key, you'll get this error message:

						<p class="code">Cryptographic failure while signing assembly 'C:\projects\NUnitAsp\source\NUnitAsp\obj\Debug\NUnitAsp.dll' -- 'The key container name 'NUnitAsp' does not exist'</p>

						<p>We don't include a key in the distribution, but the NUnitAsp build script automatically generates the correct kind of key for you.  Open a Visual Studio .NET command prompt and type 'nant' in the root NUnitAsp directory to run it.  You only need to do this the first time you compile.</p>


						<h2>Q: I want to send you a patch.  What should I do?</h2>

						<p>A: Great!  We appreciate your enthusiasm and support.  The best way you can help is to send us a test case that demonstrates your bug or feature.  In your patch, integrate your test case into the existing tests.  If you can, download the latest NUnitAsp code from CVS first (see the <a href="http://nunitasp.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ReadOnlyCvsAccess">NUnitAsp Wiki</a> for more information).  The easier it is for us to run your test, the sooner we'll get to your suggestion.  Once your patch is ready, upload it to the SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49940&atid=458032">patch manager</a>, and then post an explanation to the developer <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=49940">mailing list</a>.</p>
