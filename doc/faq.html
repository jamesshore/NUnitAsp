	<p class="title">NUnitAsp Frequently Asked Questions</p>

	<p>This document contains answers to questions that really are frequently asked about NUnitAsp.  It's not the best place to start for general information about NUnitAsp.  For an overview, see the <a href="quickstart.html">NUnitAsp QuickStart Guide</a>.  For a detailed tutorial, see the <a href="tutorial/index.html">NUnitAsp Tutorial</a>.  NUnitAsp is available for download at the <a href="http://nunitasp.sourceforge.net">NUnitAsp web site</a>.</p>

	<p>At this time, there aren't many frequently asked questions, so this is a short document.</p>

	<p class="question">Q: When will NUnitAsp support NUnit 2.x?</p>

	<p class="answer">A: We will provide a special release of NUnitAsp v1.2 that supports NUnit 2.0 a few weeks after v1.2 is released.  NUnitAsp v1.2 will be the last release of NUnitAsp to support NUnit 1.x.

	<p class="question">Q: When will NUnitAsp stop requiring XHTML?</p>

	<p class="answer">A: That's our most important new feature, and is scheduled for the next release after NUnit 2.x support.  We don't have a specific release date.</p>

	<p class="question">Q: I want to send you a patch.  How do you want it?</p>

	<div class="answer">
		<p>A: Great!  We appreciate your enthusiasm and support.  The best way you can help is to send us a test case that demonstrates your bug or feature.  In your patch, integrate your test case into the existing tests.  The easier it is for us to run your test, the sooner we'll get to your suggestion.</p>

		<p>Patches that fix bugs or add features directly are also welcomed, but if you only have time to do one or the other, send us the test.</p>
