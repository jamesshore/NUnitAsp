            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

            <p>The NUnitAsp team sees frequently asked questions as indicators of problems with NUnitAsp.  We strive to eliminate FAQs by improving NUnitAsp itself, so this isn't the best place to start for general information about NUnitAsp.  For an overview, see the <a href="quickstart.html">NUnitAsp QuickStart Guide</a>.  For a detailed tutorial, see the <a href="tutorial/index.html">NUnitAsp Tutorial</a>.  For installation issues, see the <a href="installation.html">Installation Guide</a>.  NUnitAsp is available for download at the <a href="http://nunitasp.sourceforge.net">NUnitAsp web site</a>.</p>


            <h2>Q: How do I test if a page has redirected properly?</h2>

            <p>A: Use the <a href="api/NUnit.Extensions.Asp.HttpClient.CurrentUrl.html">Browser.CurrentUrl</a> property to look at the current URL or the <a href="api/NUnit.Extensions.Asp.WebForm.AspId.html">CurrentWebForm.AspId</a> property to look at the ASP.NET ID of the current web form.</p>


            <h2>Q: How do I test user controls and stuff in data grids?</h2>

            <p>A: See the section titled "User Controls, Data Grids, and Other Control Nesting" in the <a href="quickstart.html">Quick-Start Guide</a>.</p>


            <h2>Q: How do I test a site that requires authentication?</h2>

            <p>A: Use the <a href="api/NUnit.Extensions.Asp.HttpClient.Credentials.html">Credentials property</a> on HttpClient to set your login credentials.  For example, to use your current login, you would use this code:

            <p class="code">Browser.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;</p>

            <p>You may also include a username and password when you retrieve a URL:</p>

            <p class="code">Browser.GetPage("http://username:password@example.com/myPage.aspx");</p>


            <h2>Q: Why doesn't NUnitAsp support frames / Javascript / pop-up windows / more HTML controls?</h2>

            <p>A: NUnitAsp's purpose is to enable test-driven development of ASP.NET code-behind methods.  If you use NUnitAsp to do so, you'll find that the lack of Javascript, etc. is much less of an issue.  When you write an NUnitAsp test, focus on testing the behavior of a specific page or even a specific user control.  We expect you to ignore frames, Javascript, and other client-side issues and focus on testing code-behind logic.</p>

            <p>We would like to provide more robust client-side support, but given our limited manpower, we have decided to focus on the code-behind unit-testing aspect of NUnitAsp instead.  If these features are important to you, well-written and tested <a href="contribute.html">code contributions</a> are always welcome.  You may also <a href="consulting.html">fund development</a>.</p>


            <h2>Q: When I try to compile NUnitAsp in VS.NET, I get a &quot;cryptographic failure&quot; error.  What's wrong?</h2>

            <p>A: The NUnitAsp DLL is <em>strong-named,</em> which means it must be signed by a cryptographic key.  If you try to compile without a key, you'll get this error message:</p>

            <p class="code">Cryptographic failure while signing assembly 'C:\projects\NUnitAsp\source\NUnitAsp\obj\Debug\NUnitAsp.dll' -- 'The key container name 'NUnitAsp' does not exist'</p>

            <p>We don't include a key in the distribution, but the NUnitAsp build script automatically generates the correct kind of key for you.  Open a Visual Studio .NET command prompt and type 'nant' in the root NUnitAsp directory to run it.  You only need to do this the first time you compile.</p>


            <h2>Q: When I try to compile NUnitAsp with NAnt, the build says &quot;External program returned errors&quot;.  What's wrong?</h2>

            <p>A: The build script is set up to work with .NET 1.0 by default.  It sets an environment variable called DotNetToolDir to point to your .NET 1.0 directory.  If that directory doesn't exist, the build won't be able to find "sn.exe" and will fail with this error:</p>

            <p class="code">keypair:
              <br />[exec] sn -k NUnitAsp.snk
              <br />
              <br />BUILD FAILED
              <br />E:\devtools\nunitasp\NUnitAsp.build(50,4): External program returned errors, see  build log for details.
              <br />Try 'nant -help' for more information
            </p>

            <p>To correct this, make sure you've set DotNetToolDir correctly and that sn.exe is in that path.</p>


            <h2>Q: When will NUnitAsp stop requiring XHTML?</h2>

            <p>A: <b>Done!</b> As of version 1.4, NUnitAsp no longer requires XHTML.</p>


            <h2>Q: When will NUnitAsp support NUnit v2.2?</h2>

            <p>A: <b>Done!</b> As of version 1.5.1, NUnitAsp supports NUnit v2.2.</p>


            <h2>Q: When will NUnitAsp support Visual Studio .NET 2003?</h2>

            <p>A: <b>Done!</b> As of version 1.4, NUnitAsp works with Visual Studio .NET 2003.  The NUnitAsp .sln file will remain on the original version of Visual Studio .NET unless someone sends <a href="mailto:jlittle82@sourceforge.net">me</a> a complementary copy of VS.NET 2003.  (Microsoft: hint, hint.)</p>


            <h2>Q: How do you spell "NUnitAsp?"</h2>

            <p>A: "NUnitAsp" is spelled in accordance with .NET framework naming standards.  Like .NET's "HttpWebRequest" and "SqlConnection" classes, the first letter of each word is capitalized and acronyms are treated as a single word: N Unit Asp.  It's pronounced "en unit a ess pee."  It is <em>not</em> spelled "NunitAsp," "NUnitASP," or (heaven forbid) "nUnit.ASP."</p>
