						<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

						<p>This document contains answers to questions that really are frequently asked about NUnitAsp.  It's not the best place to start for general information about NUnitAsp.  For an overview, see the <a href="quickstart.html">NUnitAsp QuickStart Guide</a>.  For a detailed tutorial, see the <a href="tutorial/index.html">NUnitAsp Tutorial</a>.  NUnitAsp is available for download at the <a href="http://nunitasp.sourceforge.net">NUnitAsp web site</a>.</p>

						<p>At this time, there aren't many frequently asked questions, so this is a short document.</p>


						<h2>Q: When will NUnitAsp support NUnit 2.0?</h2>

						<p>A: With the release of version 1.2.1, NUnit 2.0 support is now available.


						<h2>Q: When will NUnitAsp stop requiring XHTML?</h2>

						<p>A: That's our most important new feature, and is scheduled for our next release.  We don't have a specific release date.</p>


						<h2>Q: When I try to compile NUnitAsp, I get a &quot;cryptographic failure&quot; error.  What's wrong?</h2>

						<p>A: The NUnitAsp DLL is <em>strong-named,</em> which means it must be signed by a cryptographic key.  If you try to compile without a key, you'll get this error message:

						<p class="code">Cryptographic failure while signing assembly 'C:\projects\NUnitAsp\source\NUnitAsp\obj\Debug\NUnitAsp.dll' -- 'The key container name 'NUnitAsp' does not exist'</p>

						<p>We don't include a key in the distribution, but the NUnitAsp build script automatically generates the correct kind of key for you.  Open a Visual Studio .NET command prompt and type 'nant' in the root NUnitAsp directory to run it.  You only need to do this the first time you compile.</p>


						<h2>Q: I want to send you a patch.  What should I do?</h2>

						<p>A: Great!  We appreciate your enthusiasm and support.  The best way you can help is to send us a test case that demonstrates your bug or feature.  In your patch, integrate your test case into the existing tests.  If you can, download the latest NUnitAsp code from CVS first (see the <a href="http://nunitasp.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ReadOnlyCvsAccess">NUnitAsp Wiki</a> for more information).  The easier it is for us to run your test, the sooner we'll get to your suggestion.  Once your patch is ready, upload it to the SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49940&atid=458032">patch manager</a>, and then post an explanation to the developer <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=49940">mailing list</a>.</p>
