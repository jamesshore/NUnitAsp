            <h1>Training Course: Test-Driven ASP.NET<br /><small>September 13-15, 2005, Bellevue, WA</small></h1>

            <p>We are very proud to announce our new public training course, "Test-Driven ASP.NET."  Co-developed by <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com">James Shore</a>, the primary developer of NUnitAsp and winner of the 2005 Gordon Pask award for contributions to agile practice, and <a href="http://www.netobjectives.com">Net Objectives</a>, creator of advanced developer training courses, this course is the most authoritative test-driven ASP.NET course available.</p>

            <p>To register for this course, <a href="mailto:jshore@titanium-it.com">contact James Shore</a> as described in the "logistics" section below.</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>

            <p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a powerful tool for combining software design, testing, and coding to increase reliability and productivity.  With ASP.NET, however, Microsoft has created a tool that doesn't easily lend itself to test-driven development.

            <p>Furthermore, the ease of creating ASP and ASP.NET applications has led to established applications that don't have any tests, making changes difficult and risky.  Savvy developers have been looking for ways to apply test-driven development to both new and existing code so they can make changes quickly and safely.</p>

            <h2>What You Will Learn</h2>

            <p>In this course, we will teach you how to use NUnitAsp to perform test-driven ASP.NET.  We will show you "best practices" for performing test-driven development of new ASP.NET and then dive into the challenges and solutions of adding tests to existing code.  We'll provide guidance in test-driven development, NUnitAsp, and throw in lots of pithy comments derived from years of experience with architecting web applications.</p>

            <p>Your instructors, James Shore and Rob Myers, have years of experience in software development and have constructed this course personally.  They'll go "off script" at the drop of a hat <i>[just try to stop us! -JS]</i> and will gladly respond to your questions with their insights and expertise.

            <h2>Course Overview</h2>

            <p><i>Day 1: TDD with NUnitAsp</i></p>

            <p>What is test-driven development?  Why do we care?  How does NUnitAsp work?  When should we use NUnitAsp, and when should we just use NUnit alone?  Take a deep breath as we immerse you in learning and experimenting with TDD using NUnitAsp.  We'll show you the best ways to create a new application using TDD.

            <p><i>Day 2: Simplifying Tests with Test-Beds</i></p>

            <p>What about complicated applications?  What about our existing applications that don't have tests?  We'll show you how to use test-beds to surgically target your tests.  We'll teach you the nitty-gritty of NUnitAsp architecture and show you how to leverage its strengths to isolate pages and user controls from the dependencies of login and navigation.</p>

            <p><i>Day 3: Mocks and Dealing with Untestables</i></p>

            <p>What is "untestable?"  What can be done with tough external dependencies?  Learn how to use mock objects in concert with test-beds to isolate ASP.NET code-behind from the rest of your application.</p>

            <h2>Lab</h2>

            <p>All three days mix lecture, demonstrations, activities, and hands-on lab assignments.  Students are required to provide their own computer (see "Prerequisites").</p>

            <h2>Who This Course Is For</h2>

            <p>Software developers (engineers, programmers, whatever you wish to call yourselves) working with ASP or ASP.NET projects.  Managers and QA folks are always quite welcome, too, but must meet the prerequisites.</p>

            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>A strong grasp of one of the .NET languages, such as C#.NET or VisualBasic.NET.  Please note that samples, exercises, and demos are all done using C#.</li>
              <li>An understanding of basic web-application architecture.</li>
              <li>Some experience with ASP or ASP.NET web-application frameworks (or an innate ability to experiment and explore with a reckless fearlessness).</li>
              <li>A laptop or desktop computer with Visual Studio .NET and Internet Information Server (IIS) installed.  Please, no beta .NET frameworks.</li>
              <li>Ample sleep or the caffeinated beverage of your choice.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructors:</h2>

            <p><b>James Shore</b> created today's NUnitAsp while leading a team in the beta days of .NET.  Unwilling to develop without the safety net of test-driven development, he took over an Brian Knowles' open-source application and made substantial improvements.  Since releasing NUnitAsp on SourceForge in 2002, he's seen it grow into an application that's downloaded thousands of times every month.</p>

            <p>James is a leader in the agile software development community.  In addition to producing NUnitAsp, he's the project maintainer for Fit, Ward Cunningham's tool for agile requirements testing and collaboration.  In 2005, the Agile Alliance recognized Jim's contributions with its prestigious <a href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2005/07/30#gordon-pask">Gordon Pask Award</a> for Contributions to Agile Practice.  James has been coaching teams in agile development since 1999 and specializes in providing agile development consulting to the Pacific Northwest.  Find his articles and blog on his website, <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com">http://www.jamesshore.com</a>.</p>

            <p><b>Rob Myers</b> has nearly twenty years of professional experience in software development, including projects for industry leaders in medical, aerospace, and financial services.   In the late 90's, Rob became an Extreme Programming coach and traveled throughout the country assisting teams as they adopted agile practices and object-oriented design techniques.  Rob brings to the classroom his passion for value-oriented software development, team development, and sane work environments.</p>
