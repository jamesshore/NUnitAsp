To do:
* Address InnerText vs. InnerXml.  Remove HtmlTag.BodyNoTags.
* Review form variables' use of Element/Tag (Tag should be protected, not internal or public)
* Exceptions need to be organized
* Explanatory message: UserControlTester.FindControl should throw exception explaining control nesting
* Make these HttpClient methods public: SetFormVariable, ClearFormVariable, SubmitForm
* FAQ: No change to "get" without postback (eg, tracker #1106130)
* Look into HtmlAgilityPack HTML parser: http://blogs.msdn.com/smourier/archive/2003/06/04/8265.aspx
* FAQ: <csc> error: lib/nant/nant.exe.config <platform name="win32" default="net-1.1">  (Cory Foy, "Build problems," 4/11-4/13/05)
* HTML controls: HtmlInputButton, HtmlInputCheckBox, HtmlInputFile, HtmlInputHidden, HtmlInputImage, HtmlInputRadioButton, HtmlInputText, HtmlSelect, HtmlTable, HtmlTextArea
* Instantiate HTML controls by XPath in addition to ID


Before release:
* Update build: remove NUnit, put NUnitAdapter.cs in bin/ dir
* Copy new constructors to every tester (don't forget WebFormTester and HTML testers)
* Finish migration guide.
* Remove ControlTester.EnterInputValue/RemoveInputValue?  Make AssertEnabled explicit in tester?
* Mark 'runAtServer' HTML constructor as obsolete?
