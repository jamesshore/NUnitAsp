To do:
* Address InnerText vs. InnerXml.  Remove HtmlTag.BodyNoTags.
* Review form variables' use of Element/Tag (Tag should be protected, not internal or public)
* Exceptions need to be organized
* Explanatory message: UserControlTester.FindControl should throw exception explaining control nesting
* Make these HttpClient methods public: SetFormVariable, ClearFormVariable, SubmitForm
* FAQ: No change to "get" without postback (eg, tracker #1106130)
* Look into HtmlAgilityPack HTML parser: http://blogs.msdn.com/smourier/archive/2003/06/04/8265.aspx
* FAQ: <csc> error: lib/nant/nant.exe.config <platform name="win32" default="net-1.1">  (Cory Foy, "Build problems," 4/11-4/13/05)
* HTML controls: HtmlTable, HtmlInputFile
* Add information on SF trackers to docs
* Add to doc page? NUnitAsp innards discussion at http://blogs.pingpoet.com/overflow/archive/2004/03/18/474.aspx
* Add FAQ? Watir vs. NUnitAsp
* Check out NUnitAspInjector


ASP.NET 2.0 issues:
* VS.NET 2005 default DOCTYPE has changed--causes parser to do a slow web lookup
* MasterPage tester needed


Before release:
* Remove ControlTester.EnterInputValue/RemoveInputValue?  Make AssertEnabled explicit in tester?
* Remove "Enabled" check on all controls.  Document this.  Tracker #1262940.
* Update all [Obsolete] attributes to say "will be removed after <date>".
* Document change from BodyNoTags to RenderedInnerHtml.  Obsolete methods in: ListItemTester; Changed behavior of: ListItemCollectionTester.FindByText, ListItemTester.Value (edge case)
* Make sure people can still call 1.5.1-style static methods on "WebAssertion" class.
