To do:
* Address InnerText vs. InnerXml.  Remove HtmlTag.BodyNoTags.
* Review form variables' use of Element/Tag (Tag should be protected, not internal or public)
* Exceptions need to be organized
* Explanatory message: UserControlTester.FindControl should throw exception explaining control nesting
* Make these HttpClient methods public: SetFormVariable, ClearFormVariable, SubmitForm
* FAQ: No change to "get" without postback (eg, tracker #1106130)
* Look into HtmlAgilityPack HTML parser: http://blogs.msdn.com/smourier/archive/2003/06/04/8265.aspx
* FAQ: <csc> error: lib/nant/nant.exe.config <platform name="win32" default="net-1.1">  (Cory Foy, "Build problems," 4/11-4/13/05)
* HTML controls: HtmlSelect, HtmlTable, HtmlInputFile
* Instantiate HTML controls by XPath in addition to ID
* Add information on SF trackers to docs
* Add to doc page? NUnitAsp innards discussion at http://blogs.pingpoet.com/overflow/archive/2004/03/18/474.aspx
* Add FAQ? Watir vs. NUnitAsp
* RequiredFieldValidator (and all validators?): 'valid' behavior changes according to whether client-side scripting is on


ASP.NET 2.0 issues:
* VS.NET 2005 default DOCTYPE has changed--causes parser to do a slow web lookup
* MasterPage tester needed


Before release:
* Update build: remove NUnit, put NUnitAdapter.cs in bin/ dir
* Copy new constructors to WebFormTester and HtmlAnchorTester/HtmlInputCheckBoxTester

* Refer to David Gardiner's code-generation tool in documentation: https://sourceforge.net/projects/nunitaspcodegen/
