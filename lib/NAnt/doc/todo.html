			To Do</h1>
		<p>The following is a rough guide to what features are being worked on and when 
			they will be worked on in the future.</p>
		<h3>0.8</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			replace log class and BuildListener/Event support
			<li>
			finish documenting all tasks (copy Ant docs when possible)
			<li>
			come up with a plan that will scale to seperate tasks into different assemblies 
			(keep them in the Extra's folder?)
			<li>
			think about having seperate file sets and directory sets
			<li>
			think about how SlingShot can work with nant
			<li>
				think about droping the SourceForge from the namespace identifier.<br>
			Reason: most projects seem to be going that way and SourceForge really isn't 
			the compnay that wrote it.
			<li>
				think about renaming FileSet xml elements: includes =&gt; include, excludes = 
				&gt; exclude, name = &gt; pattern.<br>
			Reason: name is vague in its purpose, includes and excludes are misleading as 
			they should be singular
			<LI>
				add schema generation and validation for tasks</LI>
		</ul>
		<h3>0.9</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			add named filesets via a fileset task
			<li>
			ftp task
			<li>
			cvs task
			<li>
				get MailTest added to test suite</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>1.0</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			ensure nunit tests for all core classes
			<li>
			ensure code xml docs for all non private members
			<li>
			developer docs (code conventions, high level design)
			<li>
			official release
			<li>
				post announcment</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>1.1</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			additional optional but useful tasks (sql, grep)
			<li>
			scp (secure copy protocol) task - maybe just show how it can be done using the 
			exec task
			<li>
			standard input support for tasks that require input (ie, passwords when copying 
			files via scp to SourceForge)
			<li>
				nant build server - continous intergration web site project - a web server that 
				watches the source code repository for changes and does a rebuild on a commit, 
				logs the results into database, provides interface to query build logs, sends 
				email, etc...</li>
		</ul>
