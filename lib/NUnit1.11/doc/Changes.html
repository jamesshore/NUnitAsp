				Added Reloading. GUI runner will release test assembly 
  as soon as 
				tests are completed. Tried as much as possible to introduce as few breaking 
				changes and as few new requirements as possible. If you have built your 
				own runners or have extended parts of the framework, you might want to look at 
				the ReloadingChanges.txt. Many thanks to Bob Davison for his input and ideas on 
				this topic, and to Ethan Smith for doing all the work on 
				this release.</LI></UL>
		<h3>GUI</h3>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Cosmetic Fixes.
